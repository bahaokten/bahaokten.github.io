Game balance is a big concern in on-line competitive video game genre, and makes up the largest portion of the post-launch maintanence costs. 
For reference, Riot games has 1000 full-time employees working on League of Legends on game balance, maintanence, events, and new champions.
While Riot Games may be an outlier with their focus on seasonal gameplay metas, cost of smaller maintanence teams still make up the majority of post-launch development costs for majority of the on-line competitive games. 
For example Dota 2 currently has a crew of 28 developers, and CSGO has at least 7 known developers working on balancing the gameplay. [5]

While on-line competitive video game publishers have access to a wide range of data and statistics of gameplay, strategy games are generally balanced pre-launch and don't have access to real-time statistics. Companies such as Paradox Interactive and Firaxis Games known for their top-quality strategy games could be facing different game balance problems to tacke.
