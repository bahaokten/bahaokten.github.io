### Machine Learning Trial

I read the chapters 6-7 of Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and Logical Foundations by Yoav Shoham and Kevin Leyton-Brown to get a better idea of how I can implement empirical game theory and multi agent system that utilizes game theory.

### Getting Ready For Design Expo

#### Expo Presentation

Created presentation slides and speech for the expo.

The slides can be accessed [*here*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KIxlCcPXlFsFMKIKDidg5zxQkw4Nng66l8Z7_c0HAKc/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Small Tweaks

**Number of Games to play**

* Added a field to the main menu that dictates how many games are going to be played.

**Better Location For Log Files**

* Adjusted where log files are stored in, for accessibility.

**Game Settings**

* Tweaked costs and scoring to be optimal for a 20-score game.

**Tie Breaking**

* Adjusted the tie breaking logic.

**UI Adjustments**

* Made it so that the UI doesn't shift into play-field in common screen ratios such as 16:9.

* Added Title
