### Machine Learning Trial

![m](/Resources/multiagentcover.gif)

I read the chapters 6-7 of Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and Logical Foundations by Yoav Shoham and Kevin Leyton-Brown to get a better idea of how I can implement empirical game theory and multi agent system that utilizes game theory.

I spent half of this weeks on getting the machine learning agents working; however, empirical game theory was a completely new field for me so I couldn't get it to work with a 4-5 hour commitment. Although I was not able to implement machine learning this week, I do plan to finish what I started with a multi agent system that utilizes game theory.
