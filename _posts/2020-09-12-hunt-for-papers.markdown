To start my research on Project Seesaw, 
I first had to compile a list of potentially useful research papers and articles.

I looked for 30 relevant sources deciding their relevancy only by reading their titles.

Then, I read the abstract section of each paper and pointed the paper a relevancy score: `0 for irrelevant`, `1 for slightly relevant`, `2 for relevant`, and `2+ for crucially relevant`
